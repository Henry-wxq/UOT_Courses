# Your Task

Your task is to complete the code so that you can successfully run the main method.

This is very similar to the lab activity this week, but has been
reduced in terms of scope.

Note 1: make sure to push your code to the `main` branch on MarkUs, as that is the
version which will be graded.

Note 2: no self-tests are provided, but we will only lightly test your code for
basic correctness.

- See the TODOs in the files for where you need to write code.

Please refer to the provided python code as you work on implementing
the logic of the Binary Search Tree class. The `BST.contains` method and some
of the basic structure has also been implemented for you to help you get started.

You should find that the python code maps onto Java without too much trouble, but
please ask if you get stuck on any of the syntax.

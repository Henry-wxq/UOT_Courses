# Meal Planner Project

## Problem Domain
Our team is focusing on the culinary domain. We will use an API that deals with recipes and meal planning in order to create a program that allow people to manage their diet.

## Application Description
Our project involves developing a desktop application for meal planning. We aim to create a Meal Planner application allows users to create, retrieve, and save recipes. The application will provide features such as recipe recommendations, recipe filtering, recipe analysis, and recipe sharing.

The app will include the following functionalities:

1. Recipe
    1. Create own recipe
    2. Search existing recipe
    3. Save recipe
    3. Customize saved recipe
    4. Analyse the nutrition obtained
2. Community
    1. Allowing recipe sharing
3. Meal Planner
    1. Suggest recipe based on:
        1. Calories
        2. Proteins
        3. Vegetarian
        4. Allergies
        5. Ingredients
        6. Etc.

## API Documentation
We plan to make use of the Spoonacular API to implement our app's main features. It provides access to a large database of recipes, nutritional information, and ingredient data.

**Spoonacular API Documentation:** [Link to Spoonacular API Docs](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs)

Besides, to enhance the functionality of our project, we further plan to integrate weather API like OpenWeatherMap API, which considering weather data to suggest recipes based on the current weather conditions in the use's location. For example, it could recommend warm soup recipes on a cold day.

Moreover, we also consider to add APIs like, [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes) to display nearby grocery stores and markets for users to puchase ingredients conveniently; [Food2Fork API](https://food2fork.ca/#Search-Recipes) to offer a large collection of recipes and allows users to search for recipes based on available ingredients; [Nutritionix API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_q-K-ObMTZvO0qUEAxROrN3bwMujwAN25sLHwJzliK0/edit?pli=1#heading=h.73n49tgew66c) to provide users with nutritional information or their recipes and to calculate and display calorie counts, marcronutrients, etc.

# Recipe Organizer Project

## Problem Domain
Our team is focusing on the culinary domain. We aim to create a Recipe Organizer application that allows users to store, organize, and customize their favorite recipes. The application will provide features for managing ingredients, instructions, and categorizing recipes.

## Application Description
Our project involves developing a web or mobile application for recipe management. Users can input their recipes and store them in an organized manner. The application will also allow users to customize recipes, add ingredients and instructions, and search for recipes based on various criteria.


## API Documentation
We plan to integrate the Edamam Recipe API to enhance our application's functionality. The Edamam Recipe API provides access to a vast database of recipes, nutritional information, and ingredient data.
